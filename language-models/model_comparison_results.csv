In particular, the present paper seeks to address the question of how the mechanisms underlying climate variation are likely to be understood by the public, by scientists and by policymakers.

In the previous papers, we have focused on the hypothesis that the global surface temperature has increased over time. The present study investigates this hypothesis using a variety of methods. First, using an updated version of GISTEMP data, and then",8.693243265151978,6,2024-12-28 15:49:57
